# `contrib/reactive-compiler/doc/architecture.md` says what is built and why,

# The harness — the ledger, the classifier, the apply, the trace precompile,
# the save and the server — is the stdlib `ReactiveCompiler` of that Julia,
# in every image it builds; this file is a client of its protocol.

    materialize_app(package_dir, app_dir; tracked, workload = nothing, kwargs...)

Build the application the way `create_app` does, but keep a store of the
emitted text objects, of the tracked sources and of the trace inside the
bundle — and when the store already holds a snapshot, rebuild only the delta
of the edit.

- With no store: trace the workload in a throwaway process, run
  `create_app(package_dir, app_dir; kwargs...)` with the statements of the
  trace, and found the store as snapshot 1 with the trace as
  `reactive-store/trace.jl`.
- With a store: spawn one child that boots from the bundle's own system
  image with `JULIA_REACTIVE_REUSE=1`, applies the changes of the tracked
  files, precompiles the statements of the trace, and emits the delta; then
  link the text objects of every snapshot in front of the delta into a fresh
  system image. Only `lib/julia/sys.<ext>` of the bundle changes.

Two options shape the rebuild. `trim = :on` (`JULIA_REACTIVE_TRIM`) writes
a trimmed image beside the untrimmed one, into `<app_dir>/trimmed`, and
refuses an edit that makes a call site dynamic. `image = :pages`
(`JULIA_REACTIVE_IMAGE_WRITE`) makes the rebuild write only the pages of
the image that the process wrote and append the new objects; the clean
pages come from the file of the base image. The founding writes whole.

`tracked` is a vector of `file => module` pairs: a source file to watch, and
the dotted path of the module whose `include` loads it — the empty path for
the root file of the package, whose top level is the `module` block itself.
`workload` is a file that calls the program: the founding traces it, and
`refresh_trace` traces it again from the current image. No build executes
it. The trace is the set of roots of the image: a statement that an edit
invalidated is inferred again by the rebuild child, and a specialization
that no statement names is compiled by the binary at run time. On a rebuild
`tracked` names the files to track now — a file that joined the program is
added, a removed one leaves — and without it the list of the previous
snapshot stays; the workload and the keyword arguments of `create_app` are
read from the store (`cpu_target`, `sysimage_build_args` are recorded; the
bundle steps do not run again). `precompile_execution_file` is refused: the
workload is the one script; `precompile_statements_file` joins the trace.

Both builds write the reactive image format (`reactive_image = true`, version
3): one function table in id order, one section per function, and a link with
`--gc-sections` that drops every function the table does not name. A rebuild
keeps the ids of the functions it reuses and drops the rest, so the image does
not grow with the edits. The format holds one CPU target, and a rebuild from
an image of the stock format is refused.

A rebuild classifies every changed top-level expression with an id of the
change catalog of the plan (see the stdlib `ReactiveCompiler`), and refuses the ones
that only a founding build applies: a module option, a new dependency, a
type that an untracked file names, a changed module header, an `include` of
an untracked file. A refusal raises with the reasons, and leaves the store
and the bundle as they were.

This needs the reactive Julia: a rebuild on a stock Julia refuses.

Read from the package's root file: every literal `include("…")` at the top

the included files too.

module body is an edit of a tracked file, and the rebuild applies it or
refuses it with a reason. An `include` whose argument is not a string
